# Stopwatch Project

This repository contains the code for a **simple and functional stopwatch**, created as part of **TASK02** for the **Prodigy Infotech** internship. The stopwatch allows users to start, stop, and reset the timer, along with a lap counter to track multiple time intervals. It is designed with a focus on performance and simplicity.

## Features
- **Start/Stop functionality**: Start or pause the timer.
- **Reset button**: Reset the stopwatch back to zero.
- **Lap counter**: Track and display multiple intervals (laps).
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile screens.
  
## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For the basic structure of the page.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the stopwatch logic using **`setInterval`** for time tracking.
